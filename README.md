## Spam SMS Detection
### Overview
This project uses NLP techniques to build a spam SMS classifier. The model, based on TF-IDF and Naive Bayes, distinguishes between spam and legitimate messages.

### Files
spam_detection.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for code and analysis.  
spam.csv: Dataset with labeled SMS messages.  
### Setup Libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk numpy  
### Dataset:
Download and place spam.csv in the project directory.  
### Usage
Open spam_detection.ipynb.  
Run the notebook for training and evaluation.  
Input your SMS to check classification.  
### Notes
TF-IDF for feature extraction, Naive Bayes for prediction.  
Data preprocessing: stop word removal and stemming.
